            Click here to download</a> the package and unzip it into the plugins folder of X-Plane.
            <br />
            If you made it right, there will be a subfolder like this after your installation:
            <br /><br /><code><i>X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts/﻿</i></code>
            <br /><br />
            Delete the file "please read the manual.lua" inside the Scripts folder.
            <br /><br />
            - FlyWithLua is on your PC and you want to update?<br />
            FlyWithLua can be updated in up to four simple steps:<br />
            <i>
                1) Make a backup of your files user.ini and user.exit if you have modified them. If not, just skip this step.<br />
                2) Download this ZIP archive and extract it over your installation, to exchange every file with the new version.<br />
                3) Delete the file "please read the manual.lua" inside the Scripts folder.<br />
                4) Restore the files user.ini and user.exit (only if you have modified/backup them before).<br />

        <br /><br />
        Now you are good to go and run X-Plane11 and use FlightJobs connector.
        By default, when you release the Parking Brake the connector window will popup. You can change these settings if you want.
        There is another way to open the connector window. Just click on X-Plane menu <b>Plugins->FlyWithLua->Macros->FlightJobs Connector</b>
