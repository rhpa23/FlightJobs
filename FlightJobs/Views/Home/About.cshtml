    This application was made for personal and shared use freely for MS Flight Simulator and X-Plane community,
    with the objective to improve the simulation experience from the point of view of the Pilots.
    Other similar tools place the user as an entrepreneur in aviation, buying aircraft and limiting
    their flights by type of aviation. The intention of FlightJobs is to simulate the pilot's work,
    earning money and experience to be hired by an airline company. Base on that, this tool was
    constructed and can be improved with the community suggestions.

    <strong>Some validations were not shown in the tutorial to not extend the video:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't start a job flight if there is no job activated in the Pending list</li>
        <li>You can't start a job flight if you don't have any job activated for the aircraft location in XP</li>
        <li>You can't start a job flight if the airplane payload is different from the active flight</li>
        <li>You can't finish a job flight if the aircraft location in XP is different from the active job destination</li>
        <li>You can't finish a job flight if the airplane payload is different from the active flight</li>
        <li>
            You can't finish a job flight if you accelerate the sim time or change the aircraft location.<br />
            The application will validate the arrival at the destination in a short time, based on the distance.
